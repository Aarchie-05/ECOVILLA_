## :label: The problem ECOVILLA solves
We strongly believe in protecting our holy Rivers and preserve their Pureness. So our mission is to save and nurture them and stretch this cause among more and more youth.

Secondly, we have observed a lot of paper wastage within various organisations. So, we have started this initiative of collecting and recycling the waste paper and use it for something good. And we also have an ecommerce page where all the products are made from the recycled paper collected from various organisations.

A plant is planted on the name of the buyer from this website and location picture of the plant is sent to the buyer.We are providing a customised panel for corporate offices and institutional organizations producing bulk of paper waste.

Tie-up with us to get rid of your scrap and add value to that material. We want to develop such a device that can measure water pollution like TDS levels, chemical level, chlorine level, and many more measurements. Also, that device has a GPS locator fitted in it and a server that can notify us of the live levels measured by the device inside the water.

On our website, weâ€™ll show you the live water pollution levels of all those particular locations where the devices are fitted. In the future, we would love to make a volunteering team that can go to these polluted places and devotes their precious time to heal the water bodies by their efforts. We'll then show all the updates about our works on this page.

Basically, our website will help you to check the instant pollution levels inside the water bodies from our devices.
